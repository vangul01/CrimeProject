\title{The Utility of Hotspot Mapping for Predicting Spatial Patterns of Crime}
\author{Spencer Chainey, Lisa Tompson and Sebastian Uhlig}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

Hotspot mapping is a popular analytical technique that is used to help identify where to target police and crime reduction resources. In essence, hotspot mapping is used as a basic form of crime prediction, relying on retrospective data to identify the areas of high concentrations of crime and where policing and other crime reduction resources should be deployed. A number of different mapping techniques are used for identifying hotspots of crime – point mapping, thematic mapping of geographic areas (e.g. Census areas), spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping and kernel density estimation (KDE). Several research studies have discussed the use of these methods for identifying hotspots of crime, usually based on their ease of use and ability to spatially interpret the location, size, shape and orientation of clusters of crime incidents. Yet surprising, very little research has compared how hotspot mapping techniques can accurately predict where crimes will occur in the future. This research uses crime data for a period before a fi xed date (that has already passed) to generate hotspot maps, and test their accuracy for predicting where crimes will occur next. Hotspot mapping accuracy is compared in relation to the mapping technique that is used to identify concentrations of crime events (thematic mapping of Census Output Areas, spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping, and KDE) and by crime type – four crime types are compared (burglary, street crime, theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles). The results from this research indicate that crime hotspot mapping prediction abilities differ between the different techniques and differ by crime type. KDE was the technique that consistently outperformed the others, while street crime hotspot maps were consistently better at predicting where future street crime would occur when compared to results for the hotspot maps of different crime types. The research offers the opportunity to benchmark comparative research of other techniques and other crime types, including comparisons between advanced spatial analysis techniques and prediction mapping methods. Understanding how hotspot mapping can predict spatial patterns of crime and how different mapping methods compare will help to better inform their application in practice.

\section*{Summary}

In the paper \cite{crimeRate} the authors propose to use POI and taxi flow data, which reflect how people commute in the city, to make inference on crime.  They hypothesize that taxi flows may be considered as “hyperlinks” in the city that connect the locations and use such data to estimate crime rates. Taxi flows may be a proxy for broader patterns of population routine activity and mobility, commuting flows, and other forms of social and economic exchanges between two communities over space. 

They use linear regression and negative binomial models, tests of different combinations of features, present construction of features, importance of features, and propose theoretical interpretations of the results.

In summary, the contribution of this paper are: 
\begin{enumerate}

\item They study crime inference problem by utilizing new urban data: POIs and taxi flows. 

\item  Utilizing these data improves the crime rate inference. 

\item Experiments are used to compare different results and feature combinations. 
\end{enumerate}
All the related work can be categorized in the following categories:
\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Time-centric paradigm}. This line of work focuses on the temporal dimension of crime incidents.

\item \textbf{Place-centric paradigm}. Most existing work. Predict the location of crime incidents, usually referred by the term \textit{hotspot}.

\item \textbf{Population-centric paradigm}. Research focuses on the criminal profiling at individual and community levels.

\end{description}

They use POI to enhance the demographics information and use taxi flow as hyperlinks to enhance the geographical proximity correlation.  They do not consider the temporal dimension of crime in depth.

Their problem is population-centric because they try to profile the crime rate for Chicago community areas, where, community areas are well-defined and stable geographical regions.  The proposed POI features and taxi links provide new perspectives in profiling the crime rate across community areas.

The crime data collected in Chicago has detailed information about the time and location of crime and the types of crime. The term crime count refers to number of crime incidents in a region in a year. The community area is used as geographical unit of study, since it is well-defined, historically recognized and stable over time. Crime rate is the crime count normalized by the population in a region. We use vector  to denote the crime rates in regions. The crime rate inference problem is to estimate the crime rate in one region using the crime rate of other regions in the same year by considering the features of regions and correlations between regions.

They study the crime rate inference problem, estimate the crime rate of some regions given the information of all the other regions. For community area $t$ with crime rate $y_t$ missing, and  use the crime rate of all the other regions $\{y_i\}-y_t$ to infer this missing value. The problem is described as
$$\hat{y_t}=f(\{y_i\}- y_t,X), $$
where $X$ refers to observed extra information of all those community areas.Two types of features $X$:

\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Nodal feature}. Describe the characteristics of the focal region, demographic information and POI.

\item \textbf{Edge features}

(1) Geographical influence, crime rate of the nearby locations. 

(2) Hyperlink by taxi flow. Locations are connected through the frequent trips.  Two regions that are more strongly connected through social flow will influence each other’s crime rate.
