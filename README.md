Project Description

Understanding and predicting crime is a crucial task in any major city. The objective of this study is to understand the relation between crime rates and taxi usage in New York City at a granular level. We also want to see how peoples travel behavior is affected by certain weather conditions, such as rain. The idea is that people react according to how secure they feel, which extends to their travel preferences, and that more taxi usage can be expected in rainy weather conditions. Our hypothesis is that people are less likely to walk in areas subjectively deemed more dangerous, and will instead opt to use more reliable and immediate transportation such as designated taxis. We also aim to study our hypothesis under the influence of certain weather conditions such as rain. New York City will be used in this study as it provides a large amount of public data on crimes throughout the five boroughs along with an extensive amount of data from NYC yellow cab usage.
